== Description ==

This is a Wordpress plugin that will list your open source projects from
github. You can have them inserted in a standard post
or page, or have them inserted in your sidebar. 

So in short, just placing:

`{{github:username}}`

in a post would pull your projects from both github, merge them into one list,
sort them in descending order by watchers, cache it, and place the list in your post.
